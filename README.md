# DesignPatterns

Here you will find a practical application where the Singleton, observer, dependency injection, facade, composite, strategy, decorator, and factory patterns are applied.

I invite you to explore the source code to understand how each pattern is used to improve the structure and modularity of the application.

## Execute the following commands in your console

1. Run `npm install` for install dependencies.

2. Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. The application will automatically open in your browser.
