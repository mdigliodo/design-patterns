    <strong>Strategy</strong>

    <p>
        The strategy pattern is a software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at
        runtime.
        The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms
        interchangeable within that family. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
        This makes it easier to build applications that are easy to test and maintain.
